# UniPhiAGI
UniPhiAGI is a full-stack AGI framework built on UniPhiOS. It fuses high-dimensional lattice cognition, memory, planning, and reasoning with deterministic transformations and reflection utilities, enabling stable, goal-directed emergent behavior for advanced research in structured intelligence and scalable vector cognition.
